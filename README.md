Hi, I'm a passionate coder and a lifelong learner. I started coding in high school, where I learned the basics of Java and SQL. Since then, I've been exploring various programming languages, such as JavaScript, Dart, and Python. I love contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, where I can collaborate with other developers and learn from their feedback. Some of the projects I've worked on include: - A web app that uses Django and React to create interactive quizzes and surveys - A cloud-based service that uses Flask and Azure to perform sentiment analysis on text data - A Ecommerce Site in sanity io and Next js -A simple music platform in next js and MongoDB and much more... I enjoy facing new challenges and solving problems with code. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, frameworks, and libraries that can help me improve my skills and create better solutions. Some of the technologies I'm proficient in are: - Web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next js, Prisma, Django, Node js - Cloud development: Azure, Google Cloud, Firebase - Data science: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras I'm currently pursuing an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication at the National Institute of Technology. I'm interested in learning more about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. I'm also taking courses on algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to work together on a project, or just chat about coding. You can find me on GitHub, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Thanks for visiting my profile!
